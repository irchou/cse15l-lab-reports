**Command with no arguments**  
![Image](cd with no args.png)  
The working directory when the command was ran is /home/lecture1/messages.
After running the cd command with no arguments, nothing was printed, but the directory was changed to /home. This is the resulting output because running cd with no arguments will always set the directory to /home. 
The output was not an error.

**Command with a path to a directory**  
![Image](cd with directory.png)  
The working directory when the command was ran is /home. 
After running the cd command with the argument lecture1/messages, the directory was changed to /home/lecture1/messages. This is the resulting output because running cd with a path to a directory will set the directory to the working directory + the directory in the argument. 
The output was not an error.

**Command with a path to a file**  
![Image](cd with file.png)  
The working directory when the command was ran is /home/lecture1.
After running the cd command with the argument Hello.java, an error message was printed stating that Hello.java is not a directory. This is the resulting output because the directory cannot be set to be inside a file, so trying to do so will result in an error.

**Command with a path to a directory**
**Command with a path to a file**

## Command `cat`
**Command with no arguments**
