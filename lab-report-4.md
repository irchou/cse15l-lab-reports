Keys Pressed:

```
To log in to my ieng account, I typed the `ssh` command and my username before pressing `<enter>`.

## Step 5

```
Keys Pressed:
git<space>clone<space><ctrl+v><enter>
```
The `git clone` command was used to clone the forked repository. I copied the ssh clone URL of the fork and pasted it after the `git clone` command using `ctrl+v`. 

## Step 6

```
Keys Pressed:
cd<space>l<tab><enter>
bash<space>t<tab><enter>
```
To run the tests, I first moved into the new directory containing the forked repo `/lab7` using `cd`. Since the only directory starting with 'l' was `lab7`, by tabbing after typing `cd l`, the terminal filled in the rest of the command with the `lab7` directory. Then, I ran the bash script `test.sh`. I again used `<tab>` to fill in `test.sh` after typing `bash t` because the only file starting with 't' in the working directory was `test.sh`.
